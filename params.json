Microgrids can strengthen *grid resilience* and help mitigate grid disturbances because they are able to continue operating while the main grid is down, and they can function as a grid resource for faster system response and recovery.\r\n\r\n## Why use a Microgrid ?\r\n**Microgrids** also support a flexible and efficient electric grid, by enabling the integration of growing deployments of renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind and distributed energy resources such as combined heat and power, energy storage, and demand response. In addition, the use of local sources of energy to serve local loads helps reduce energy losses in transmission and distribution, further increasing efficiency of the electric delivery system.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nPart of our work contributors also are \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ahan Kak (@ahankak);\r\n    Ashwin Shirsat (@AshwinS94);\r\n    Kaustubh Shivdikar (@kaustubhcs);\r\n    Mohit Srinivasan (@mohitsrinivasan);\r\n\r\n## Whats next\r\nComing soon is a real working model of a Microgrid to present you with the *astounding* advantages of using it.","google":"UA-67839237-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
